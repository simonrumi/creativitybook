<h1>Structure</h1>

<p><p>Given that we need to balance change and repetition, what is the best way to do that? A ready made template of when to change and when to repeat would be very helpful. This is the kind of thing structures do. Structure is the invisible skeleton upon which all art forms are built. Often, if you are not trained in the particular art form, and sometimes even if you are, you won't consciously perceive the structure. When watching movies, for example, most people do not think "ah, that's the turning point, now we're entering the second act." A professional screenwriter may have such thoughts, however.</p>

<p><p>The composer Arnold Schoenberg said that the most difficult thing for the composer to do is to decide what comes next QQQQ GET EXACT QUOTE FROM SCHOENBERGS BOOK QQQ. Structure is also a tool to solve that problem. A songwriter will usually start with a plan to have 3 musical parts: a verse, a chorus, and a bridge. Each part is about equal length, and they will be arranged in the order: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus.  There are some common variations of this structure, but by and large, most popular music follows this format, so before writing a note, the songwriter knows exactly the work required of her.</p>

<p>Notice that this pre-defined template balances change and repetition (see chapter QQQ Change vs Repetition) in the song structure. The chorus is repeated 4 times, the verse repeated twice, and the bridge is not repeated. The repeated sections are not repeated back to back, except at the end where there are 2 choruses in a row, so there is almost always a change coming up, to avoid over-repetition. The chorus is the section that contains the "hook" that the writer hopes the listener will remember, so the are 4 choruses, compared with 2 verses - which avid listeners may pick up on - and a single bridge, which is really there just to provide relief from the repetition of the other sections.</p>

<p>Time-tested structures like these have evolved with Darwinian success having optimized the change/repetition balancing. Song-writers need not struggle with the question of how many sections there should be, how long they should each be, how many times they should be repeated and in what order they should be placed. They know that they need one main melody that will be their hook, and that the success of the song will depend mainly on the hook and the other parts can be considered secondary. A lot of trial and error experimentation is avoided when the song writer uses a well known structure  - in fact it is so thoroughly ingrained that most musicians make the choice without thinking. </p>
<p>	 	</p>
<p>Trying a new structure would be, for an artist, a fundamental upsetting of the cart. It would be fraught with opportunities for failure and it would likely take many attempts to create an original structure that was as successful as one of the time-worn ones. (See chapter 2035  Break Assumptions)</p>
<p> 		 	</p>
<p>Let's now look at a structure that you have almost certainly met before: Beginning - Middle - End. If you have written essays in school, you might well have been instructed to use this structure. It was presented to me in the form</p>
<p>	 	</p>
<p>"Say what you are going to say</p>
<p>Say it</p>
<p>Summarize what you said"</p>

<p>This means that in the Beginning you list the points you are going to cover, for example "This essay will explore the differences between antelopes and beavers, including their feeding habits, their behaviors and their brain capacities". Then in the Middle, the longest part with the meat of the writing, you give the information, in the order you listed in the Beginning. Finally at the end you summarize the key points from the Middle section.</p>

<p>I'm sure it has crossed the mind of many students that the Beginning and End seem superfluous - the real essay is the Middle, so why bother having truncated versions of it before and after? The reason is you are trying to teach the reader something, and it will be much more effective with the right amount of repetition. This essay structure, like the song structure, has carefully thought out repetition built into it. And just as a song ends with the chorus, containing the hook that the song writer wants you to learn, an essay ends with a summary of the information the writer wants you to learn.</p>

<p>With these 2 examples - songs and essays - we can get a sense of how structure serves a similar purpose across disciplines. Even more surprisingly it is possible to have the same structure used in completely different art forms. The Beginning - Middle - End structure is also used in film scripts.</p>

<p>A very common movie structure is in 3 sections, with important transition moments in between:</p>

<p>1. Meet the main character(s) and see them in their normal environment</p>

<p>1a. Then there is a Turning Point where something happens and forces the plot in a new direction</p>

<p>2. The middle section is a series of rising complications, where the main character(s) must overcome obstacle after obstacle</p>

<p>2a. Finally there is another Turning Point when the solution to overcoming the central obstacle is discovered</p>

<p>3. The ending sees the solution put into action and the movie resolves either positively or negatively.</p>

<p>QQQQ GET WIKIPEDIA REFERENCE FOR THIS QQQ</p>

<p>QQQ SHOW A DAIGRAM OF MOVIE STRUCTURE HERE QQQQ</p>
<p>		</p>
<p>To use the plot of Star Wars as an example, the Beginning is where we first meet Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. Luke is a farmer, with responsibilities to his family. But then his family is killed - that's the first turning point, which causes the action to "turn" in a new direction. </p>
<p>In the Middle section, Luke undertakes a mission to deliver the robot R2D2, to the Rebels (R2D2 holds plans to help destroy the enemy's super-weapon, the Death Star). To start with they must find themselves a spaceship and pilot, the first complication, which is obstructed by various underworld characters on Tatooine, then by a space battle with enemy ships. Then they are dragged into the Death Star itself, another complication...and so the complications continue to rise until finally they get R2D2 to the Rebels. </p>

<p>Using the plans they identify the method by which they can shoot down the Death Star - that is the 2nd turning point, that leads into the End section. It consists mostly of the battle itself and ultimately destruction of the Enemy's weapon.</p>

<p>Notice that in the movie, just as in the essay, the Beginning and End are relatively short, and the "meat" is in the middle. As a guideline, beginning and end acts are about 1/4 of the whole length each, and the middle takes about 1/2 the total time.</p>

<p>Another art form that uses the Beginning Middle End structure is classical music. The sections are named differently but many symphonies use it:</p>

<p>Exposition - where we hear the main theme (i.e. melody) in the "home" key</p>

<p>Development - where the composer expands on the theme, slicing and dicing it, and moving through different keys</p>

<p>Recapitulation - where the theme, intact once more, returns to the home key.</p>

<p>An excellent way to get a sense of this is by listening to the comedic take on Beethoven's 5th symphony by PDQ Bach. Sports-commentators call the “plays” as if it were a sporting event and it manages to be both funny and educational.</p>

<p>We've now looked at 3 art forms that all make use of the Beginning Middle End structure - essay writing, movies and classical music. These structural ideas have cross pollinated between disciplines at some point in the distant past. It shows that what works in one arena can be put to use in another. (See Chapter 2020 Cross Pollination). If a songwriter wanted to find a way to be deeply original, a good place for her to start would be to leave behind the common song structure described above and explore structures from other disciplines.</p>

<p>The beginning-middle-end structure is simple and doesn’t provide much detail. A structure which broadly follows the beginning-middle-end format, but fills in the details, for a specific circumstance, is the Hero’s Journey. It is a structure used in storytelling and was identified by Joseph Campbell as being a common structure used in myths across many cultures. It is for stories what the verse-chorus structure is for songs - many, many books, movies, and plays make use of the Hero’s Journey, so let’s take a look at it, again with Star Wars as our example.</p>

<p>QQQQ image of Hero’s Journey here QQQQ</p>

<p>The story starts with the hero in his home environment - Luke Skywalker in  the family farm on Tatooine.</p>

<p>2.        The hero is called to undertake an adventure or quest - R2D2 shows up with a secret message that must be delivered to the Rebels.</p>

<p>3.        However the hero refuses the call to adventure - Luke has commitments to his family and the farm. </p>

<p>4.        The hero meets the Mentor who provides a gift that will aid the hero in the quest - Luke meets the reclusive Obi Wan Kenobi, who trains Luke in use of the Force, which grants him various mystical powers useful in defeating enemies. </p>

<p>5.        Something happens to push the hero into undertaking the quest, which begins with the hero crossing the threshold from the home environment into the new adventure-world. Luke’s family is killed - the turning point, mentioned in the movie structure above - and he crosses into the adventure-world in the bar on Tatooine, inhabited by many strange beings, most of whom are none too friendly.</p>

<p>6.        In the adventure-world the hero faces various tests and the allies and enemies are defined. Luke meets his ally Han Solo, and we learn more about the Rebels (good guys) and the Empire (bad guys)</p>

<p>7.        Next the hero and some of the allies approach a major challenge. Think of Luke & co. aboard their spaceship, the Millennium Falcon seeing the enemy fortress - the Death Star - for the first time. They are literally and figuratively approaching a major test.</p>

<p>8.        In the middle of the story the hero goes through an ordeal at the center of the adventure-world. In Luke’s case this is the rescue of Princess Leia on the Death Star. The hero is confronted with death during this ordeal - the death of Obi Wan Kenobi, his mentor. However the death brings new life with it, and even as Obi Wan is struck down by the main bad guy, Darth Vader, Luke hears Obi Wan’s disembodied voice speaking to him as a spirit. </p>

<p>9.        Having faced death the hero has grasped a reward. This is embodied by Princess Leia, who was rescued. Although this is a victory the war is not won and there is danger of losing still. They must take robot R2D2 to the good guys to find out how to destroy the Death Star before it destroys them.</p>

<p>10.      The road back from the adventure-world is revealed about ¾ of the way through the story. The Rebel forces, whom Luke has joined, work out a plan to destroy the Death Star, which involves a final battle - the most dangerous yet.</p>

<p>11.     At the height of this battle the hero is given his final test in order to be resurrected in some way. At the moment that Luke is to take his nearly impossible, single shot to save all the good guys, the disembodied voice of the Mentor urges him to put aside his spacecraft's guidance systems and trust the mystical guidance of the Force. By doing so Luke crosses into complete acceptance of his mentor’s teachings - a kind of rebirth on the threshold of success or death, resolving finally the conflict from the very beginning when Luke refused the call to adventure.</p>

<p>12.       The Hero’s Journey ends with the hero returning triumphantly having gained a treasure with the power to transform the world. This treasure is the Force, which Luke has fully embraced and will become central to the Rebels’ ongoing battle with the bad guys.</p>

<p>The above structure, as applied to Star Wars, might sound as if it is just about Star Wars, but in fact it is the skeleton of many, many stories and not just adventure stories at that. It can also be applied to completely different circumstances, as shown by a great piece of cross pollination in the book Winning the Story Wars, QQQQ link to book QQQ wherein author Jonah Sachs applies this structure to marketing. In this application, the customer is cast in the role of the hero; the company with something to sell in the role of the mentor; and the product is the gift that aids the hero in the journey. Sachs cites the example of sporting goods company Nike with its long-running “Just do it” campaign, wherein heros (customers) are challenged to accomplish their fitness/sporting goals (that’s the journey) using Nike gear (the gift) to help them get there. This effective campaign looks to inspire consumers to achieve their best, which contrasts with most other advertising that plays to baser instincts, such as fear (think of cleaning product ads featuring scary germs). </p>

<p>Another use of structure in business is the strategy for startup technology companies put forth in the book Crossing the Chasm, described in Chapter 2020 Cross Pollination, where we looked at how the World War II D-day strategy was applied to a particular issue for startups. That particular tactic forms part of a larger arc for a successful business, which the book pictures as a bell curve, with the area under the curve showing the size of the market at any given point.</p>

<p>QQQ picture of the bell curve QQQ</p>

<p>The left hand tail shows the early adopters - a small number of customers who try the product when it’s new, then comes the early majority, followed by the late majority, and finally at the right hand tail is the laggards. </p>

<p>The bell curve is usually used to show the distribution of populations. For example the heights of everyone in a certain country - the horizontal axis shows the different possible heights and the horizontal axis shows how many people there are at that height. The large bulge in the middle is the average height and the graph shows that most people are near the average and those who are considerable shorter or taller than the average are rare. Notice there is no concept of time in the graph. </p>

<p>However QQQQ uses the Bell Curve as if time is moving from left to right - fewer people early on, the majority of the sales are made in the middle period of the product’s lifespan, and then there are still a few people buying the product after everyone else has made their purchases. It might not be the case that the sales of a given product would neatly and symmetrically fit into a bell curve - for example consumer products’ sales tend to spike in December - but thinking of the product lifecycle in this manner is a useful for planning. This is a mild sort of cross pollination, using the Bell Curve with a time dimension.</p>

<p>Notice also that this view of a product lifecycle could also be deconstructed as a beginning-middle-end structure. The early adopters at the beginning, the early and late majority in the middle - the time when the product makes almost all of its sales - and the laggards at the end. </p>

<p>You may find more than one structural idea can apply to the same situation. Structures are not necessarily mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>So far we have been discussing forms that unfold over time - movies, music, product lifecycles. Even essays are read over a period of time, from start to finish, each word following the other. Architecture and painting, by contrast, are examples of art forms that do not have a time component. They exist as single objects that can either be experienced all at once, or at least experienced in any order - you can gaze at a whole painting, or walk in and around a building following any path you like. Consequently there are some different kinds of structures at play.</p>

<p>The Golden Ratio is found in painting, architecture, and many other disciplines. It is perhaps considered aesthetically pleasing because it also occurs in nature. It is a simple relationship between 2 lengths where QQQQQ PUT IN GOLDEN RATIO math HERE QQQ</p>

<p>It shows up in nature in everything from seashells </p>

<p>QQQ PIC OF SPIRAL SEA SHELL WITH GOLDEN RATIO QQQ</p>

<p>To human faces</p>

<p>QQQQ PICTURE OF HUMAN FACE WITH GOLDEN RATIO QQQQ</p>

<p>In fact, the more that a face adheres to the golden ratio, the more it conforms to our concept of good looking.</p>

<p>QQQ PICS  OF FACE DISTORTED TO BE LESS, AND MORE, ADHEREANT TO GOLDEN RATIO QQQQ</p>

<p>Nobody is ever going to get fired for using the Golden Ratio - it pretty much guarantees a pleasing outcome. Hence we find it in buildings:</p>

<p>QQQQQ PICS OF BUILDINGS USING GOLDEN RATIO - does Transamerica building use it? QQQQ</p>

<p>And in paintings:</p>

<p>QQQQQ PICS OF FAMOUS PAINTINGS USING GOLDEN RATIO QQQ</p>

<p>It could also be used in time-based art forms as well - a song or a play could have section lengths that adhered to the Golden Ratio.</p>

<p>Another example of a static structure is the tree structure. Trees have large trunks, that break out into smaller and smaller branches, eventually ending in leaves. This is another example, like those found in Chapter 2020 Cross Pollination where a large part of the work done is in support of the final task - photosynthesis - rather than in doing that actual work. Company organization charts are tree structures with the CEO at the trunk, and the folders in computer operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, Android, etc) are tree structures. The tree structure is very familiar, but it is not used much in art - perhaps this is an area ripe for exploration.</p>
