	<h1>The Spirograph Problem</h1>
	<p>Human brains have the possibility to "think outside the box" whereas computers can only think inside it. This is because a computer program, even a very complicated, learning system, is designed by programmers who must create a set of rules within which the program runs. Algorithms are in fact a set of rules, and computer programs are a collection of detailed algorithms. In other words computer programs are rules and the rules are the "box" - computer programs can't go outside of this box because the programs are the box.</p>

	<p>The Spirograph demonstrates the problem of being inside such a box. A Spirograph is an arts &amp; crafts product made in QQQQQ</p>
