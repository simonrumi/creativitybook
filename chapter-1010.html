	<h1>Automation of Everything</h1>
	<p>Everything that can be automated will be, and a huge amount of the jobs today have the potential to be automated. In the long term this will be a much larger affect than any current worries about jobs in the developed world going to the developing world.</p>

	<p>With advancing technology, more and more tasks no longer require people to perform them. When Henry Ford broke down the making of a car into a series of steps and created the concept of a modern factory, he still needed humans to perform many of the tasks. However with advances in technology, today we have robots replacing the humans, to automate much more of the process. The making of a car today employs far fewer humans than it did in the early 20th century</p>
