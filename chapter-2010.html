<p><h1>Change vs Repetition</h1><p>

<p><p>The balance between repetition and change is a core concept that pervades all artistic fields. Let's jump into some examples to demonstrate.<p>

<p><p>Here's the first 4 notes of Beethoven's 5th symphony:<p><p>

<p><p>Don't be afraid if you can't read music, for our discussion you just need to know a couple of things:<p>

<p><p>1. The 2 notes with the holes in them are long, held notes<p>

<p>2. The other notes are short, quick notes<p>

<p>3. Notes that a written higher on the page also sound higher in pitch.<p>

<p>If you know how these very famous opening notes sound, hum them to yourself. If not, I strongly recommend you try a quick search on YouTube.com and have a listen.<p>

<p>In these first 8 notes Beethoven starts with a repetition - 3 quick notes of the same pitch - and then he immediately follows that with a very big change - a note that is long rather than short and lower in pitch. Then his next 4 notes are a repeat of the first 4 (internally containing that repetition followed by a change) but not an exact repeat since the whole 4-note group is lower in pitch than the first group, so Beethoven has managed to combine a repetition and a change in one.<p>

<p>All that changing and repetition, at multiple levels, and these are only the first 8 notes! The remainder of the piece is built upon the first 4 notes in the way a cathedral is built from blocks of stone - it is for good reason that this is one of the most famous pieces of music in western history. Try listening to the whole thing and see if you can hear that 4 note idea throughout.<p>

<p>For a second example let's look at architecture. Here's a picture of the Marin Civic Center designed by renowned architect Frank LLoyd Wright.<p>

<p>QQQQ PIC OF MARIN CIVIC CENTER QQQQ<p>

<p>Where Beethoven had his 4 note motif, Frank Lloyd Wright has a shallow arch. It can been seen in multiple repetitions along the side of the building, but each row as a whole is a change compared with the others as the arches move from very large at street level to small at the top of the building, and, if you look at the detail on the edges of the roof, there are miniature arches there also. These arches are all flat, 2 dimensional arches, but the center piece of the building is a large blue dome, which is the a 3D version of the arch, making it contrast starkly in shape and color with the rest of the arches, but at the same time connected with them.<p>

<p>The arch theme is everywhere, even in the parking lot where the lamps are capped with a shallow dome, this time in brick red.<p>

<p>Even though Beethoven and Frank Lloyd Wright are working in completely different media, and are separated by hundreds of years, they are essentially doing the same thing. At its core all art is a balance between change and repetition.<p>

<p>Other examples can be found in graphic design. In the book "Design for Non-Designers" by QQQQ, the author talks about 4 principles for graphically laying out a page<p>

<p>Contrast<p>
<p>Repetition<p>
<p>Alignment<p>
<p>Proximity<p>

<p>Contrast is really the authorâ€™s word for change and repetition means exactly the same thing as we have just been discussing.<p>

<p>For example have a look at this poster:<p>

<p>QQQ PIC OF POSTER QQQQ<p>

<p>Notice the sun - a large orange circle - which is repeated by the fact of having many other flat colored circles on the page; but there's also change (contrast) in that the circles are different sizes and colors.<p>

<p>As for alignment and proximity I would suggest that these are concepts in page layout that are themselves subject to repetition and change. Look at the writing at the top of the page - aligned to the left and grouped together. The left alignment extends (repeats) the line along the left. The edge made on the left is repeated by each line of text that is aligned left. Likewise the writing at the bottom of the page is aligned to the right, creating another line. The 2 groups of writing provide a change in the proximity - the writing could have been all together in a single block, but the artist decided to break them apart and move them as far away from each other as possible.<p>

<p>This is just a cursory glimpse of the many useful ideas in QQQQ's book, which I recommend.<p>

<p>For a final example lets consider choreography, which involves arranging human bodies in the space defined by the stage. In this image we see 3 dancers all repeating the theme of a diagonal line, made by an arm and a leg in the men, and by the 2 legs of the woman. The lines are pointing in one direction for the men and the mirror image is given by the woman. While the repetition of the diagonal is obvious, it is a repetition with change embedded in it.<p>

<p>QQQ IMAGE OF DANCERS HERE QQQ<p>

<p>Of course choreography is an art form that unfolds over time, and here we are just capturing an instant, but nevertheless you get an idea how movement of one or more trained dancers can contain themes, just like Beethovens 4 notes and Frank Lloyd Wrights shallow arch above.<p>

<p>Chose any art form and you will find artists who are balancing, whether consciously or not, repetition and change. So what is it about these concepts that make them central?<p>

<p>Firstly, let's consider some cases where the balance is tipped in one direction or the other. Much of modern art does this. Consider the works of Jackson Pollock<p>

<p>QQQQ JACKSON POLLOCK PIC HERE QQQ<p>

<p>This mass of paint splattered on the canvass has very little in the way of repetition. There's no repeated shape, no repeated color, nothing, at least at first glance, to "catch the eye." This is the very reason many people find this sort of work challenging and even refuse to consider it as a work of art. There's paint everywhere but nothing to look at. Pollock was presumably doing all this on purpose, shocking the viewer by taking away the grounding that had been taken for granted - a painting that is all change and no repetition leaves us adrift with no oar.<p>

<p>A similar example in music is the twelve tone system of Arnold Schoenberg. You may not be familiar with any pieces that use this system, because they have not caught on...probably for the very reason that the balance of repetition and change is too skewed toward change to make for a normal listening experience. Schoenberg developed a system of arranging the tones in a musical piece so as to avoid the piece falling into any particular key. A key in a piece of music is the central harmony that all the notes revolve around. Most notes in a "regular" piece will be part of a key and those which aren't will stand out as being different, even grating and harsh. Schoenberg erased the sound of a central key in his pieces using his twelve tone system, so like Pollock, he left his audience without a center to grasp on to.<p>

<p>Of course there are people who love Pollock paintings and Schoenberg's music. Art is subjective, and every person brings their own set of experiences - a group of patterns in their brain - to the work.<p>

<p>In both the works of Pollock and Schoenberg, with repeated listening/looking, the determined can find elements to grasp on to. Maybe parts of a Pollock painting can suggest certain shapes in the same way that you can find figures in the random clustering of clouds. With repeated hearing of a Schoenberg piece you would get to know what's going to happen next...you'd become used to it. Or by being familiar with other, similar works, there would be a sort of meta-repetition, not within the work, but of the type of work.<p>

<p>What you would be doing is to impress your own stamp of repetition on the artist's work - the artist gave you no repetition, so you supplied it by listening or looking at it over and over again, or by repeated exposure to art of the same genre. When confronted with a new, abstract piece, that piece would have many established brain patterns with which to be associated, creating a tolerance for the lack of internal repetition in abstract art forms.<p>

<p>In contrast someone who has not spent a lot of time with abstract art, does not have the requisite brain patterns established and finds themselves groping for meaning.<p>

<p>Expanding on Chapter 2005, Patterns, our brains' process is one of<p>

<p>Getting new input<p>
<p>Categorizing the input into patterns<p>
<p>After repeated aquaintence with the input, delegate its pattern-recognition to subconscious parts of the brain.<p>

<p>At step 3 we have so thoroughly learned something that we are no longer paying attention to it. Advertisers might do well to keep this in mind - after having exposed someone to their product offering enough times for them to learn it, repeated exposure will have less and less additional effect.<p>

<p>Step 3 is also the point where we are looking for something new to turn our conscious minds to. This is where the balance between repetition and change comes in. Too much repetition and the audience is bored. Not enough and we don't have enough time to categorize the input. Get it right and you have a hit, fail and you flop. If you think about any activity where you have once enjoyed it and then become bored - playing tic tic toe for example - you will recognize that the boredom stems from becoming too familiar with the task. In the case of tic tac toe, you soon realize there are a limited number of possibilities for the game and so the challenge disappears.<p>

<p>Video games make use of the repetition/change balance as well. Video games are really programs that teach - they teach the skills needed to play the game. They start simply and get more and more complex. The learning is done by repetition - you repeat a task until you have won at it enough times, then the game lets you continue to the next level, which is harder. If the game designer has managed to balance the game just right - this process is in fact called "game balancing" - you will repeat a task until you have mastered it, but not long enough to get bored by it. At that point you need a change.<p>

<p>Interestingly games designers have found that they should not increse the difficulty of a game in a linear fashion, by steadily getting harder and harder. instead the player will enjoy the journey more if the difficulty increases in short bursts, with some period of respite after each big hump. For example once you have shot down a swarm of invaders and been granted a more powerful weapon, you get to easily vanquish your foes for a while, before being presented with a bigger bad guy who is impervious to your new weapon.<p>

<p>QQQ GRAPH OF GAME DIFFICULTY OVER TIME QQQQ<p>

<p>Getting the balance between change and repetition right can be highly effective. A hit song is a hit because it is presenting your brain with a short musical phrase - the "hook" - which is repeated a lot over the course of 3 or 4 minutes. However, especially toward the end of the song, when straight out repetition of the hook would become boring, the underlying musical arrangement usually changes - perhaps the instrumentation builds up, the singer adds improvisational lines, etc. Listen to some of your favorite songs and see if you can hear this. Thos changes keep our interest held, while the hook repeats. When it is over, we may find ourselves singing the hook. Just as a game teaches the players how to play the game, a song is essentially a mechanism for teaching us a musical phrase, and it has done that by repetition coupled with enough change so as to keep our attention. Interestingly the musical education does not encompass teaching the whole song, just the hook. Most people do not remember all the words and music in a song, however simply repeating a single musical phrase for 3 minutes would be too repetitive, so there needs to be other material as well, to give us a break in between lessons.<p>

<p>More than just preventing us from getting bored, an enjoyable piece of music with good balance between change and repetition is actively engaging our conscious mind. Think about a time when you have been driving and listening to music. The driving is largely automatic, providing you are not a beginner subconscious layers of your mind are doing a lot of the work for you. However if you come to a point in your journey when you need to concentrate - if you are looking for an unfamiliar turnoff, or a street number, for example - the first thing you do is turn the music down or off. This is because the music is competing for the attention of your conscious mind, but you need that for something else.<p>

<p>The skillful balancing of change and repetition, found in hit songs, art, architecture and every other art form, is easy to understand as a concept, somewhat harder to perceive in the work of others, and putting it into practice is something that can keep you engaged for a lifetime. It is not a formula that guarantees good results by following a set of steps, but a tool with which you can build something good or bad.<p>
