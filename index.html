			<h2>Chapter 1010</h2>
			<h1>Automation of Everything</h1>
			<p>Everything that can be automated will be, and a huge amount of the jobs today have the potential to be automated. In the long term this will be a much larger affect than any current worries about jobs in the developed world going to the developing world.</p>

			<p>With advancing technology, more and more tasks no longer require people to perform them. When Henry Ford broke down the making of a car into a series of steps and created the concept of a modern factory, he still needed humans to perform many of the tasks. However with advances in technology, today we have robots replacing the humans, to automate much more of the process. The making of a car today employs far fewer humans than it did in the early 20th century</p>

			<h1>The Spirograph Problem</h1>
			<p>Human brains have the possibility to "think outside the box" whereas computers can only think inside it. This is because a computer program, even a very complicated, learning system, is designed by programmers who must create a set of rules within which the program runs. Algorithms are in fact a set of rules, and computer programs are a collection of detailed algorithms. In other words computer programs are rules and the rules are the "box" - computer programs can't go outside of this box because the programs are the box.</p>

			<p>The Spirograph demonstrates the problem of being inside such a box. A Spirograph is an arts &amp; crafts product made in QQQQQ</p>
